I Love Emilia
=============

Car Brand is a nice person. He wants to declare his love to his girl. Unfortunately, another trash girl also likes him. In order to announce to the trash girl about his feelings, he decides to put his confession into irrefutable words, and send it to everyone. The trash girl intercepts the message, but is unable to open it. Can you help the trash girl realise the feeling of Car Brand?

Brownie points to those who know what anime I am making this reference from and who both the girls are.

Solution
========

To solve this question, you are required to send a query at the port and host that the server is setup on. So let us try that out. For this example, server is setup on localhost:7777.

    $ curl localhost:7777 -v
	* Rebuilt URL to: localhost:7777/
	*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
	* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 7777 (#0)
	> GET / HTTP/1.1
	> Host: localhost:7777
	> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
	> Accept: */*
	> 
	* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
	< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	< Server: BaseHTTP/0.6 Python/3.5.2
	< Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2017 15:17:14 GMT
	< Content-type: text/plain; charset=printable-ascii
	< 
	* Closing connection 0
	Header password missing%                                                                                             


So there is something fishy in the headers. It speaks of a charset=`printable-ascii`. It also says that a header `password` is missing.

	$ curl localhost:7777 -v -H password:password
	* Rebuilt URL to: localhost:7777/
	*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
	* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 7777 (#0)
	> GET / HTTP/1.1
	> host: localhost:7777
	> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
	> Accept: */*
	> password:password
	> 
	* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
	< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	< Server: BaseHTTP/0.6 Python/3.5.2
	< Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2017 15:18:24 GMT
	< Content-type: text/plain; charset=printable-ascii
	< 
	* Closing connection 0
	uint8 expected%   

So we make a guess with the password `password`, which is as good as any to start, and we see that it points out that a unit8 is expected.

	$ curl localhost:7777 -v -H password:10
	* Rebuilt URL to: localhost:7777/
	*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
	* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 7777 (#0)
	> GET / HTTP/1.1
	> Host: localhost:7777
	> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
	> Accept: */*
	> password:10
	> 
	* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
	< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	< Server: BaseHTTP/0.6 Python/3.5.2
	< Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2017 15:25:54 GMT
	< Content-type: text/plain; charset=printable-ascii
	<

So we get a garbage, binary output, for a password of 10. On doing a little bruteforce, we get the following.

	$ curl localhost:7777 -v -H password:84
	* Rebuilt URL to: localhost:7777/
	*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
	* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 7777 (#0)

Which is the only printable-ascii output that we get from the password. But it is still not done. But I see that there are a lot of 'x' characters in this file. Let's highlight that.
